# Known Issues:
This app is EXTREMELY low tech and contains bugs.
- Light/Dark Mode is wonky, and sometimes requires switching back and forth to get the desired state.
- Changing font size will switch things to Dark Mode, which can be done by toggling Light/Dark
- Scrolling only works by clicking/dragging the sidebar. Touchpad scrolling is not functional.
